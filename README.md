# College Predictor System
This the project of the Data Science where we predict the collegese for the student after their marks by the model. The model is based on the report of the various NIT and IIT colleges and their admission procedure.

First, we analyze the data of the different colleges and their stat for admission in various programs, then the model suggest the student top colleges as per their features to get admission in it.

📌 Overview
The College Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application that helps students predict the colleges they may get admission to, based on their rank, category, quota, pool, and institute type (IIT/NIT).

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to analyze past admission data and provide accurate predictions. The system is deployed as a web app using Flask for the backend and an interactive frontend.

🚀 Features

✅ Predicts possible colleges based on rank & category

✅ Uses KNN Algorithm for prediction

✅ User-friendly Flask web app interface

✅ Dataset-driven, easy to update with new data

✅ Helps students plan better for counseling
